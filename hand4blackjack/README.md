Cards have the following values:

Cards 2 to 9 have a value equal to their number
Face cards (the King, Queen and Jack have a value of 10
The Ace has a value of 11, unless the total value of the hand exceeds 21. If that happens, the card's value is 1.
Suits are not significant
There are no other cards, such as Jokers, to consider
