Level Up Rust: Challenge 1
Your challenge is to implement a function, median(), that takes a vector of floating point numbers (Vec<f32>) and returns the median as a floating point number.

Your return value should be wrapped in an Option type to account for cases where the input list is empty. When that occurs, there is no meaningful median.

Testing your code
To test your solution, use cargo test.

$ cargo test
