Level Up Rust: Challenge 14
Your challenge is to implement run-length encoding. Design functions encode() and decode() that takes can encode and decode &str (string slices).

Note: When a run has more than 9 consecutive elements of the same character, you should break the run into two to avoid parsing ambiguities.

Note: To make the challenge more difficult, modify your encode() function to accept arbitrary data streams ([u8]), while returning valid String. Your decode() function should do the inverse. This will require you to introduce an escaping mechanism to enable unprintable bytes to be printed.

Testing your solution
Use cargo test to evaluate yourself:

$ cargo test
...
running 2 tests
test abc ... ok
test round_trip ... ok
